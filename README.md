# **How to Train your Dragon movie series**
## *By dream works*
---
 A novel series by Cressida Cowell, published from 2003 to 2015, about the adventures of a young Viking named Hiccup and his dragon Toothless. A CGI animated film series by DreamWorks Animation, loosely based on the novels, consisting of three films released in 2010, 2014, and 2019, and several spin-off TV shows and short films.

 I like the film because of its character building and story, it made me cry in all three films as if I was part of the story. What I like about is the music, they gave chills and a sense of joy, sorrow and thrill. Every scene is immaculate and i would watch it over and over again
